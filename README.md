# WSAN-RFID-Wireless-Lock-
In this project, a wireless lock system has been designed based on RFID and WSAN technologies. This system can be used in various services and applications such as Smart Home or Smart Parking. It includes two nodes (TX and RX), which communicate with each other from the long-range length (about a kilometer). The TX node is responsible to identify users and send action signals to the RX node. The RX node based on TXâ€™s action signals decisions to what it should do. The CPU of both nodes are Arduino Nano and the Transceivers are NRF24l01+ modules. I designed and implemented this project for my Microcontrollers course.    
o	Successfully and implemented for the Microcontrollers course.
o	Designed with TX and RX nodes to communicate wirelessly and securely.
o	Developed by Arduino Nano as the CPUs and the NRF24l01+ modules as transceivers
